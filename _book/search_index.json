This is increasing the demands on crowded emergency departments (ED) and contributes to increased ambulance turnaround times. Yorkshire Ambulance Service introduced a specialist paramedic (SP) role to try and address this, but non-conveyance rates in this group have not been much greater than regular paramedics. Methods We conducted a controlled interrupted time series analysis to study appropriate non-conveyance rates before and after the GP rotation. A costing analysis examined the average cost per appropriate non-conveyance achieved for patients receiving care from intervention group SPs compared to a matched control group. Results Between June 2017 and December 2019 there were 7349 incidents attended by intervention group SPs and eligible for inclusion. Following removal of cases with missing data, 5537/7349 (75.3%) cases remained. Post-placement, the intervention group demonstrated an increase in appropriate non-conveyance rate by 32.2% (95%CI 20.1–44.3%, p=&lt;0.001) and a reduction in the trend of appropriate non-conveyance relative to the control group of -1.8% (95%CI -3.5—0.0%, p=0.045). Post-rotation, intervention group SPs cost a mean of £322.92 per incident (95% CI £318.1–£328.07), compared to £352.36 per incident (95% CI £348.05–£356.28) for the control group. Cost per appropriate non-conveyance for intervention SPs was a mean of £501.94 (95%CI £478.55–£525.91) versus £1217.89 (95%CI £1124.16–£1322.38) for the control group. Conclusion In this single NHS ambulance service study, we found a clinically and statistical significant increase in appropriate non-conveyance rates by SPs who had completed a 10-week GP rotation. This improvement persisted for the 12-month period following the rotation and was cheaper compared to usual care. "]
