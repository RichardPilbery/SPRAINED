## Abstract {-}

### Introduction {-}
Ambulance conveyance rates in the UK NHS are almost 70%, despite an increase in non-emergency cases. This is increasing the demands on crowded emergency departments (ED) and contributes to increased ambulance turnaround times. Yorkshire Ambulance Service introduced a specialist paramedic (SP) role to try and address this, but non-conveyance rates in this group have not been much greater than regular paramedics.


### Methods {-}
We conducted a controlled interrupted time series analysis to study appropriate non-conveyance rates before and after the GP rotation. A costing analysis examined the average cost per appropriate non-conveyance achieved for patients receiving care from intervention group SPs compared to a matched control group.

### Results {-}
Between June 2017 and December 2019 there were 7349 incidents attended by intervention group SPs and eligible for inclusion. Following removal of cases with missing data, 5537/7349 (75.3%) cases remained. Post-placement, the intervention group demonstrated an increase in appropriate non-conveyance rate by `r adf$level_val`% (95%CI `r adf$level_ci`%, p=`r adf$level_p`) and a reduction in the trend of appropriate non-conveyance relative to the control group of `r adf$trend_val`% (95%CI `r adf$trend_ci`%, p=`r adf$trend_p`). 

Post-rotation, intervention group SPs cost a mean of £`r adf$rp_mean_cost_per_inc` per incident (95% CI £`r adf$rp_ci_per_inc`), compared to £`r adf$control_mean_cost_per_inc` per incident (95% CI £`r adf$control_mean_ci_per_inc`) for the control group. Cost per appropriate non-conveyance for intervention SPs was a mean of £`r adf$rp_mean_cost_per_nc` (95%CI £`r adf$rp_ci_per_nc`) versus £`r adf$control_mean_cost_per_nc` (95%CI £`r adf$control_ci_per_nc`) for the control group.

### Conclusion {-}

In this single NHS ambulance service study, we found a clinically and statistical significant increase in appropriate non-conveyance rates by SPs who had completed a 10-week GP rotation. This improvement persisted for the 12-month period following the rotation and was cheaper compared to usual care.
